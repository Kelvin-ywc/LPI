# [ACM MM 2024] Official implementation of the paper "Low-rank Prompt Interaction for Continual Vision-language Retrieval"


The code for image-text retrieval(retrieval) is based on  [S-prompts](https://github.com/iamwangyabin/S-Prompts).
The code for referring expression comprehension(grounding) is based on [GLIP](https://github.com/microsoft/GLIP).

Some bugs need to be fixed...
